        <p>There are two types of API keys:</p>
        <li><b>GLOBAL_API_KEY</b> – Serves as the primary access key for the application, managing authentication and tracking API usage across different client applications.</li>
        <li><b>USER_API_KEY</b> – Grants access to specific user roles within the application, such as Admin or User, ensuring appropriate authorization for different functionalities.</li>
        <p>For further details on authentication, request structure, and endpoint usage, please refer to the complete API documentation.</p>'
